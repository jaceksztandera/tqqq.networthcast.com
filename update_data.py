Fetches daily closing prices for QQQ, TQQQ, SPY, SOXX, SOXL, and QQQ5 (the
Leverage Shares 5× Long Nasdaq 100 ETP on LSE, yfinance ticker `QQQ5.L`)
from Yahoo Finance and short-term interest rates from FRED, then writes
them as TSV files consumed by index.html.

Pre-IPO history is fabricated by walking actual daily index values backward
from each ETF's first real trading day, applying the leveraged-return-minus-
expense formula PLUS the financing-cost correction for leveraged ETFs:

    synth[t-1] = synth[t] / (1 + L × ret − (L-1) × rate_daily − expense_daily)

The (L-1) × rate_daily term reflects the interest cost real leveraged ETFs
pay on the borrowed portion of their notional exposure. Empirically the
naive formula (no rate term) overstates real TQQQ by ≈2 × short_rate per
year — verified by regressing 2010-present naive-vs-real drift against Fed
Funds rate: slope 1.998 (theory predicts exactly 2.0), R² 0.97.

  SPY  1988 → 1993    ← ^SP500TR                     (1× − SPY expense)
  SOXX pre-2001       ← ^SOX                         (1× − SOXX expense)

  QQQ5 1999 → 2021    ← derived NDX-TR               (5× − 4×rate − QQQ5 exp)

QQQ, SPY, and SOXX have leverage 1, so (L-1) × rate = 0 — no financing-cost
term. TQQQ, SOXL, and QQQ5 get the rate correction.

The local ^ndx_d.csv extends pre-1985 history. The actual NASDAQ-100 index
didn't exist before 1985-01-31, so values before that are a back-reconstruction
by the data provider. Treat pre-1985 synth QQQ/TQQQ as "what would have been"
not "what was".

The "derived NDX-TR" trick: real QQQ_adj returns ≈ NDX-TR − QQQ_exp; real
QQQ_raw (split-adjusted only, no dividend reinvestment) returns ≈ NDX − QQQ_exp.
Multiplying ^NDX × (QQQ_adj/QQQ_raw) cancels the QQQ_exp from both sides and
recovers a daily NDX-TR series straight from real market data — not an
annualized estimate. This is what lets the TQQQ 1999-2010 phase track real
TQQQ to within QQQ's small tracking error instead of the −0.6%/yr structural
drift you'd get from chaining through QQQ_adj directly.

Known biases (after the financing-cost correction):

  - For pre-1999 QQQ and TQQQ we have only ^NDX (price-only) — Yahoo lists
    ^XNDX (NDX Total Return) but serves no history for it; NASDAQ.com's API,
    NASDAQ Data Link, Stooq, Tiingo, EODHD, Alpha Vantage all gate it.
    Pre-1999 synth QQQ understates ~0.7%/yr; pre-1999 synth TQQQ ~2%/yr.
  - For 1985-10-01 → 1987-12-31 SPY uses ^GSPC (price-only) because
    ^SP500TR's Yahoo history starts 1988-01-04. Measured TR premium over
    that overlap is +3.86pp/yr, so ~9% cumulative understatement for that
    2.3-year window.
  - Residual operational drag of ~1.3 pp/yr (swap spreads, NAV/market price
    deviations, daily rebalancing slippage) is NOT modeled. Real TQQQ
    underperforms our rate-corrected synthesis by roughly that constant
    amount across all rate regimes.
